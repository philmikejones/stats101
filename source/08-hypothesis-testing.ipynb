    "## Interpreting the results\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two problems to be aware of when interpreting the results of a hypothesis test.\n",
    "The hypothesis test does not *prove* an association between our variables; it gives us a statistical level of confidence that there is an association.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is always a risk that we might reject the null hypothesis (i.e. state that there is an association) when there isn't one.\n",
    "In our example we have good statistical evidence that there is an association (the $p$ value is very low), but there is still a possibility that this could have simply happened randomly (admittedly a very small chance).\n",
    "\n",
    "If this were a random occurrence but we stated there was an association this would be called a **Type I (one) error**, sometimes known as a false positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other type of error we could make is failing to reject the null hypothesis when we should (i.e. we state there is no association when there *is* one), also known as a false negative.\n",
    "This is known as a **Type II (two) error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform a hypothesis test we therefore need to balance the risk of stating that there is an association when there isn't, and the risk of stating that there is no association when there is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on our research question, one or the other errors might be more problematic.\n",
    "For example, if we are testing a new drug we want to make sure it is effective, so we do not want to make a type I error (i.e. state that there is an association when there isn't one).\n",
    "But if we're testing the drug for side effects we want to make sure we don't make a type II error (i.e. assert that there are no side effects when, in fact, there are)."

    "## Directional tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Two--tailed tests are the default, and what you should use unless you have a very good (and documented!) reason for using a one--tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "One--tailed tests are used when we are carrying out a *directional* test.\n",
    "For example, we previously tested if there is an association between employment grade (NS--SEC) and housing tenure.\n",
    "We did not specify a direction, so we would usually use a two--tailed test.\n",
    "However, if we specified our alternative hypothesis with a direction, we would run a one--tailed test.\n",

    "\n",
    "> People of higher employment grade are **more likely** to own their own home\n",
    "\n",
    "we now have a directional test (i.e. we don't think they're less likely to own their own home).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we can use a one--tailed test.\n",
    "Note that we have stated our hypothesis **before** we ran the test; you cannot run a one--tailed test after the fact and claim you've found a directional association.\n",
    "Also note that if you do not find a directional association and later want to switch direction you cannot.\n",
    "Therefore one--tailed tests tend to be used when previous literature identifies a directional association and you want to use new data to test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this skepticism of one--tailed tests is that they require a smaller difference between the two variables to be statistically significant.\n",
    "If you are performing a non--directional (two--tailed test) at a confidence level of 0.05, your have half of this at each end of your distribution (0.025) to work with to detect a difference.\n",
    "If you specify a directional (i.e. one--tailed test) you have more of the distribution to work with to detect a significant difference."
