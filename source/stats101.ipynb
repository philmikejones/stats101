    "The normal distribution was discovered by Gauss (which is why it's also sometimes called the Gaussian distribution) and described an 'ideal' situation. Lots of data follow this pattern: the height or weight of a population;  The mean of the normal distribution ($\\mu$ on the diagram above) is the centre. Because the normal distribution is **symmetrical** we know that 50% of cases fall below and 50% of cases fall above the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful property of the normal distribution is we know, or can calculate, how many cases fall with 1, 2, 3, or more standard deviations of the mean (these are shown as $\\mu \\pm \\sigma; \\mu \\pm 2\\sigma; \\mu \\pm 3\\sigma$ on the figure). These are about 68%, 95%, and 97.5% respectively.\n",

    "|Number of $\\sigma$ from mean | Percent of cases|\n",
    "|-----------------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| 1                           | 68.27%          |\n",
    "| 1.96                        | 95%             |\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore if we know the mean ($\\mu$) and standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of our sample we can calculate the confidence interval of our sample mean (as we did above). Typically we calculate a 95% confidence interval (although 99% is also common), and this tells us the likely range the population mean falls within. This is why we used the figure 1.96 when calculating our confidence interval earlier, and this is the property that allows us to infer information about the population from our smaller sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other, related, way we can use this information is if we have a mean and standard deviation and observe a data point, we can calculate how many standard deviations from the mean this data point is. We can then see if the observed data point falls within the normal variation we expect (i.e. within 1.96 standard deviations for 95% confidence) or outside it, and is therefore the result of something not within the normal range.\n",
