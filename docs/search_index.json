At its most simplistic (and I completely acknowledge that I’m massively generalising here), we usually seek to describe the world or quantify the world. For these tasks we use qualitative methods and quantitative methods respectively. To quantify the world we might want to know things like, “how many people have been a victim of crime?”, “how many people have mental health problems?”, or “how many people have social science degrees?”. Sometimes we have complete (or near–complete) data about everybody in a population. For example, in the UK the decennial (i.e. every ten years) census is a count of everybody, including certain characteristics such as health, education, and employment. In this case the population is everybody in the UK. More often than not it is impractical to ask everybody our questions. Usually the cost and time required to carry out such a survey prohibit asking every single person what we want to know, but also very few people would answer everything that they were asked (the only reason everybody responds to the census is because it’s a crime not to complete the census and people have been prosecuted for not completing it). Instead we take a sample of the population, and infer, from our sample, what the population is like. For example, we might ask a random sample of 1,000 people what their favourite hot drink is. It’s not that we want to know what this 1,000 people think more than any other 1,000 people. Instead, they are our sample and, based on their responses, we can infer what the most popular hot drink is for the population. In the UK, the most popular hot drink is tea, but everybody knows it should be coffee. Figure 1.1: Coffee is clearly better than tea Obtaining knowledge about a population by inferring from a sample is the cornerstone of quantitative social science research, and uses many statistical techniques to be able to do this. The good news is the most difficult challenge is often deciding which technique to use; using the technique is often like following a recipe. 1.1 License © 2018 Phil Mike Jones.

["levels-of-measurement.html", "2 Levels of measurement 2.1 Nominal 2.2 Ordinal 2.3 Interval 2.4 Ratio", " 2 Levels of measurement Levels of measurement describe the nature of your data point. They are important because they determine what statistical tests you can perform on them. The four levels of measurement are: 2.1 Nominal Also known as categorical. These are labels such as male/female; no religion/religion. They have no inherent order; one response is not ‘better’ or ‘higher’ than another. As social scientists you’ll find these are pretty common. 2.2 Ordinal Similar to nominal in that they are labels (rather than numbers), but the labels have a rank or order. For example, a ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’ scale is ordinal. Another example would be ‘guilty’ and ‘not guilty’. 2.3 Interval Interval data is numerical but does not have a meaningful zero value. The most common example often given is temperature expressed in degrees celcius. A temperature of 20°C is not twice as hot as 10°C, because 0°C is arbitrary rather than based on the absence of heat. A more common example in the social sciences is date. Years are based on an arbitrary zero (0AD); months are based on twelve months that do not have a ‘zero’; days do not have a zero and reset each month. 2.4 Ratio Ratio data is again numerical, but differs from interval because it has a meaningful, non–arbitrary, zero. As we saw above dates are interval, but age in years is ratio because zero years old is the lowest age you can be. It is more common for numerical data to be ratio than interval. Other examples include income and number of events (e.g. number of crimes in an area). "],
["central-tendency.html", "3 Central tendency 3.1 Mode 3.2 Median", " 3 Central tendency Measures of central tendency is a fancy phrase for ‘average’. They are a single data point used to represent a ‘typical’ value from your data. Depending on your level of measurement you can use one or more measures of central tendency. 3.1 Mode The most common unique value. For example, 10 people are asked their favourite drink and you have the following results: ## [1] &quot;espresso&quot; &quot;latte&quot; &quot;tea&quot; &quot;tea&quot; ## [5] &quot;earl gray&quot; &quot;americano&quot; &quot;hot chocolate&quot; &quot;tea&quot; ## [9] &quot;hot chocolate&quot; &quot;tea&quot; The most common result (mode) is tea, which we can confirm with a quick frequency table: drinks %&gt;% count(choice) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## choice n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 tea 4 ## 2 hot chocolate 2 ## 3 americano 1 ## 4 earl gray 1 ## 5 espresso 1 ## 6 latte 1 Mode is the only measure of central tendency you can provide for nominal data. 3.2 Median The median is the ‘middle’ point. It’s only appropriate for ordered data and is calculated by arranging your data in order and selecting the mid–point. Consider the following incomes: ## [1] 6762.511 9793.139 11752.264 13249.284 14484.484 15550.132 16496.807 ## [8] 17355.421 18146.349 18883.788 19578.068 20236.974 20866.546 21471.585 ## [15] 22055.995 22623.012 23175.369 23715.412 24245.192 24766.529 25281.065 ## [22] 25790.308 26295.663 26798.464 27300.000 27801.536 28304.337 28809.692 ## [29] 29318.935 29833.471 30354.808 30884.588 31424.631 31976.988 32544.005 ## [36] 33128.415 33733.454 34363.026 35021.932 35716.212 36453.651 37244.579 ## [43] 38103.193 39049.868 40115.516 41350.716 42847.736 44806.861 47837.489 If we arrange these in order from lowest to highest we get: ## [1] 6762.511 9793.139 11752.264 13249.284 14484.484 15550.132 16496.807 ## [8] 17355.421 18146.349 18883.788 19578.068 20236.974 20866.546 21471.585 ## [15] 22055.995 22623.012 23175.369 23715.412 24245.192 24766.529 25281.065 ## [22] 25790.308 26295.663 26798.464 27300.000 27801.536 28304.337 28809.692 ## [29] 29318.935 29833.471 30354.808 30884.588 31424.631 31976.988 32544.005 ## [36] 33128.415 33733.454 34363.026 35021.932 35716.212 36453.651 37244.579 ## [43] 38103.193 39049.868 40115.516 41350.716 42847.736 44806.861 47837.489 The median is the middle point (note that this is not realistic data): ## [1] 27300 "]
