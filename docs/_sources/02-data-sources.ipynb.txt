    "Each row represents a person (person 1, 2, or 3) and each column represents a piece of information about that person, or a *variable*.\n",

    "Reading across the top row, we can see that person 1 is aged 36, is male, and prefers coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary data (data that someone else has collected) will usually come in this form, and it is good practice to enter our primary data (data we collect) in this form too.\n",
