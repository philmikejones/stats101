<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#Introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As social scientists and researchers we want to answer questions about
the social world. At its most simplistic (and I completely acknowledge
that I’m massively generalising here), we usually seek to describe the
world or quantify the world. For these tasks we use qualitative methods
and quantitative methods respectively.</p>
<p>To quantify the world we might want to know things like, “how many
people have been a victim of crime?”, “how many people have mental
health problems?”, or “how many people have social science degrees?”.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have complete (or near–complete) data about everybody in a
population. For example, in the UK the decennial (i.e.&nbsp;every ten years)
census is a count of everybody, including certain characteristics such
as health, education, and employment. In this case the population is
everybody in the UK.</p>
<p>More often than not it is impractical to ask everybody our questions.
Usually the cost and time required to carry out such a survey prohibit
asking every single person what we want to know, but also very few
people would answer everything that they were asked (the only reason
everybody responds to the census is because <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_in_the_United_Kingdom#Criminal_law">it’s a crime not to
complete the
census</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/27/120-convicted-census-forms-2011">people have been prosecuted for not completing
it</a>).
Instead we take a <em>sample</em> of the population, and <em>infer</em>, from our
sample, what the population is like.</p>
<p>For example, we might ask a random sample of 1,000 people what their
favourite hot drink is. It’s not that we want to know what this 1,000
people think more than any other 1,000 people. Instead, they are our
<em>sample</em> and, based on their responses, we can <em>infer</em> what the most
popular hot drink is for the <em>population</em>. In the UK, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/697383/favorite-hot-drinks-united-kingdom-uk/">most popular
hot drink is
tea</a>,
but everybody knows it should be coffee.</p>

<p>Obtaining knowledge about a <em>population</em> by <em>inferring</em> from a <em>sample</em>
is the cornerstone of quantitative social science research, and uses
many statistical techniques to be able to do this. The good news is the
most difficult challenge is often deciding which technique to use; using
the technique is often like following a recipe.</p>
