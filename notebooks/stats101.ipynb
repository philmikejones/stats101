    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "These are my notes on statistics and quantitative methods for analysis in the social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "As social scientists and researchers we want to answer questions about the social world.\n",
    "At its most simplistic (and I completely acknowledge that I'm massively generalising here), we usually seek to describe the world or quantify the world.\n",
    "For these tasks we use qualitative methods and quantitative methods respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the world we might want to know things like, \"how many people have been a victim of crime?\", \"how many people have mental health problems?\", or \"how many people have social science degrees?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we have complete (or near--complete) data about everybody in a population.\n",
    "For example, in the UK the decennial (i.e. every ten years) census is a count of everybody, including certain characteristics such as health, education, and employment.\n",
    "In this case the population is everybody in the UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not it is impractical to ask everybody our questions.\n",
    "Usually the cost and time required to carry out such a survey prohibit asking every single person what we want to know, but also very few people would answer everything that they were asked (the only reason everybody responds to the census is because [it's a crime not to complete the census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_in_the_United_Kingdom#Criminal_law) and [people have been prosecuted for not completing it](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/27/120-convicted-census-forms-2011)).\n",
    "Instead we take a *sample* of the population, and *infer*, from our sample, what the population is like.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might ask a random sample of 1,000 people what their favourite hot drink is.\n",
    "It's not that we want to know what this 1,000 people think more than any other 1,000 people.\n",
    "Instead, they are our *sample* and, based on their responses, we can *infer* what the most popular hot drink is for the *population*.\n",
    "In the UK, the [most popular hot drink is tea](https://www.statista.com/statistics/697383/favorite-hot-drinks-united-kingdom-uk/), but everybody knows it should be coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Coffee is clearly superior to tea](../images/coffee.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining knowledge about a *population* by *inferring* from a *sample* is the cornerstone of quantitative social science research, and uses many statistical techniques to be able to do this.\n",
    "The good news is the most difficult challenge is often deciding which technique to use; using the technique is often like following a recipe.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nominal\n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as **categorical**.\n",
    "These are labels such as male/female; no religion/religion.\n",
    "They have no inherent order; one response is not 'better' or 'higher' than another.\n",
    "As social scientists you'll find these are pretty common.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to nominal in that they are labels (rather than numbers), but the labels have a rank or order.\n",
    "For example, a 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree' scale is ordinal.\n",
    "Another example would be 'guilty' and 'not guilty'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval data is numerical but does not have a meaningful zero value.\n",
    "The most common example often given is temperature expressed in degrees celcius.\n",
    "A temperature of 20&deg;C is not twice as hot as 10&deg;C, because 0&deg;C is arbitrary rather than based on the absence of heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more common example in the social sciences is date.\n",
    "Years are based on an arbitrary zero (0AD); months are based on twelve months that do not have a 'zero'; days do not have a zero and reset each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio data is again numerical, but differs from interval because it has a meaningful, non--arbitrary, zero.\n",
    "As we saw above dates are interval, but age in years is ratio because zero years old is the lowest age you can be.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the types of 'further information' that can help us is a measure of spread of the data around the mean value.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. subtract the mean from each score\n",
    "1. square the result\n",
    "1. sum the results to produce one value\n",
    "1. divide by $n - 1$ (number of observations minus one)\n",

    "Using $n - 1$ rather than simply the number of observations is known as [Bessel's correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction).\n",
    "To calculate the variance of the population we must assume that the population mean is the same as the sample mean that we have observed.\n",
    "In fixing the population mean we reduce the degrees of freedom of our observations, because if we change these the final observation is determined in order for the mean to remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if our sample mean is 100 we assume our population mean is also 100.\n",
    "If we have two observations these might be 110 and 90 (mean 100).\n",
    "If we change the 110 value to 120, the 90 value *must* change to 80 to ensure the sample mean (and therefore the population mean) remains 100, so there is only one degree of freedom.\n",
