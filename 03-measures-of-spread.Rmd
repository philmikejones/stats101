# Measures of spread

We saw in the measures of central tendency chapter that the mean can be a poor representation of data if the data is skewed, and that we should therefore be careful when someone presents us with a mean (or average) without any further information.

One of the types of 'further information' that can help us is a measure of spread of the data around the mean value.
We usually use the *variance* and the *standard deviation* to quantify measure of spread.
Both are easy to calculate, and even easier to convert between each other.


## Variance

Lets recap: this is what the income data looks like:

```{r income}
dat %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  as.vector()
```
